Thank you for using Flashify. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This policy explains how Flashify handles user data and what permissions it requires.

1. Information We Collect
Flashify does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data. All app features—such as flashlight control, compass, and Qibla direction—process data locally on your device and do not transmit it externally.

2. Permissions Used and Purpose

    CAMERA: Required solely to access and control the device’s flashlight. No photos or videos are captured, viewed, or stored.

    ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION / ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION: Used only to determine your current location for the compass and Qibla direction functionalities. This data is accessed only while the app is running and is neither stored nor shared.

    VIBRATE: Enables haptic feedback during user interaction, enhancing usability.

3. Third-Party Services
To support advertising in the app, Flashify may use Huawei Ads Kit or other Huawei services. These services may collect certain data as per their own privacy policies.
We recommend you refer to the privacy terms of Huawei’s advertising services for further details.

4. Children’s Privacy
Flashify does not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13. If any such data is inadvertently collected, it will be deleted immediately.

5. Data Security
As no personal data is collected or stored by us, Flashify inherently minimizes the risk of data breaches. All processiang is done on-device, ensuring user privacy.

6. Policy Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future. Users are encouraged to check this page regularly for any updates. Any changes will take effect immediately upon posting.
